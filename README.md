# Review Classification with Generative AI

This project leverages the **OpenAI API** and **Generative AI** to classify product reviews into **sentiments** (positive, negative, neutral) and **sub-attributes** (e.g., quality, price, etc.). The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, using Python, Pandas, OpenAI, and scikit-learn.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language
- **OpenAI API**: For generative AI-based classification
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and processing
- **scikit-learn**: For model evaluation
- **Jupyter**: For notebooks and exploratory data analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization

## Objective
The goal of this project is to apply **Generative AI** to classify product reviews based on **sentiment** (positive, negative, neutral) and **sub-attributes** (such as quality, price, etc.). The project uses a pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Repository Structure

- **data/**: Contains raw and processed data.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- **src/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Review-Classification-Generative-AI.git
   cd Review-Classification-Generative-AI
